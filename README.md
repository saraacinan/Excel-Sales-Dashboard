# Excel Sales Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Excel Sales Dashboard project. In this project, I have utilized Microsoft Excel to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard for analyzing sales data. The dashboard allows users to monitor key sales metrics, explore sales distribution across different regions, states, products, and shipping modes, and interactively filter the data for deeper insights.

## About Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains a variety of information related to sales transactions. Here's a brief description of the dataset columns:

- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed
- **State**: State where the product was sold
- **Region**: Region associated with the sale (Central, East, South, West)
- **Category**: Main product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
- **Sub-Category**: Specific sub-division of the main category (e.g., Chairs, Tables, Bookcases, Furnishings)
- **Product Name**: Name of the product sold
- **Sales**: Revenue generated from the sale
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold
- **Profit**: Profit earned from the sale
- **Ship Mode**: Method of shipment (Standard Class, Second Class, Same Day, First Class)
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer
- **Segment**: Customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)

## About Dashboard

The Excel Sales Dashboard presents key performance metrics and visualizations, including:

- **KPI Cards** displaying:
